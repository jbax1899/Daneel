# Ethics Core Risk Evaluation & Circuit Breakers

## Purpose
Add **incident logging** and **deterministic circuit breakers**.

This milestone establishes:
- a user-facing way to **report Ari messages** (with consent),
- a private, durable **incident record** (SQLite on Fly volume),
- and an ethics-core-owned **risk evaluation + breaker action** layer that gates responses.

---

### Rules

* Ethics-core is the **final decider** for breaker actions. The planner may “suspect” but is non-authoritative.
* **Fail open** by default (pipeline should degrade gracefully), except where a breaker rule explicitly requires refusal.
* Prefer **pseudonymized** identifiers and **minimal retained content**.
* Add only the **structured event logs** needed to audit incidents and breaker trips; avoid a full logging rewrite. 

---

## What exists today

* Provenance footer includes a “Report Issue” entry point, but it is a stub.
* SQLite trace store exists and is written per-response (provenance).
* ethics-core has RiskTier/types, but risk evaluation is stubbed/unwired.
* Superuser concept is minimal (developer env ID only).
* Logging is Winston-based with partial privacy coverage, but not event-structured for incidents/breakers.

(Assume code is source of truth; this doc is a working plan.)

## Phase 1 — IncidentStore (SQLite) + audit events

**Goal:** Create first-class durable incident records with lifecycle and append-only audit trail.

**Key tasks**

* Add an IncidentStore module in `shared` (or similar) using better-sqlite3.
* Create tables:

  * `incidents` (status, tags, pointers, timestamps, remediation flags)
  * `incident_audit_events` (incident_id, actor_hash, action, notes, timestamp)
* Add store factory wiring next to trace store factory.

**Deliverable:** `IncidentStore` can create incidents, update status, and append audit events; schema auto-inits on boot.

---

## Phase 2 — Pseudonymization utilities

**Goal:** Ensure incident persistence and incident logs never store raw Discord identifiers.

**Key tasks**

* Implement `hmacId(secret, rawId)` helper (HMAC-SHA256 recommended).
* Apply hashing for: reporter, guild, channel, message IDs (and any “actor” identity in audit events).
* Add tests to prevent regressions (no raw IDs in incident DB rows or incident logs).

**Deliverable:** Pseudonymization is used consistently across incident creation, auditing, and alert payloads.

---

## Phase 3 — Report submission UX (Discord-only, consented)

**Goal:** Replace the “Report Issue” stub with a real report flow.

**Key tasks**

* Interaction flow:

  * click “Report Issue” → explicit consent step (“I consent” / “Cancel”)
  * optional inputs (tags, description, contact) via modal/selects
* Auto-capture context:

  * message jump link + message ID pointers
  * provenance pointers when available (responseId / traceId / model hash / chain hash)
* Store report as `status = new` and append an `incident.created` audit event.

**Deliverable:** Reporting creates a durable incident record with consent and captured pointers, without requiring user copy/paste.

---

## Phase 4 — Immediate remediation (edit reported Ari message)

**Goal:** When Ari is reported, edit the target message to add a warning and spoiler/obscure content.

**Key tasks**

* Implement idempotent “mark message under review” helper:

  * detect existing marker and skip if already remediated
  * apply spoiler wrapping or safe placeholder for long/edge cases
* Record remediation applied + timestamp on the incident.

**Deliverable:** A reported Ari message is reliably edited once, with remediation tracked.

---

## Phase 5 — Superuser review tooling (private)

**Goal:** Allow maintainers (and later moderators) to review and manage incidents privately.

**Key tasks**

* Add superuser allowlist via `.env` (CSV of IDs) and enforce on commands.
* Commands:

  * list (filters: status/date/tag)
  * view (details + pointers)
  * update status (reviewed/confirmed/dismissed/resolved)
  * add internal note (audit event)

**Deliverable:** Superusers can triage incidents end-to-end; every action is auditable.

---

## Phase 6 — Alerts (Discord ping + admin email)

**Goal:** Notify maintainers when new incidents arrive (and/or when confirmed).

**Key tasks**

* Add env-configured alert targets:

  * Discord channel/role mention
  * SMTP email recipient(s)
* Payload must be redacted:

  * include incident short ID, tags/status, jump link, provenance pointers
  * exclude raw content and raw IDs

**Deliverable:** Alerts can be enabled/disabled by config, and are safe by default.

---

## Phase 7 — ethics-core risk evaluation (deterministic) + breaker rules

**Goal:** Make ethics-core the authoritative engine for risk evaluation and breaker actions.

**Key tasks**

* Replace stubs with:

  * deterministic classification of content categories (starter set)
  * mapping to actions (block / redirect / safe partial / ask for human review)
  * stable `ruleId` output for audit/logging
* Accept “planner suspicion” as optional hints, but do not depend on it for safety.

**Deliverable:** `evaluateRiskAndBreakers(input) -> { riskTier, action, ruleId, notes }` is stable and testable.

---

## Phase 8 — Enforcement hook in message pipeline

**Goal:** Apply breaker results before sending a response.

**Key tasks**

* In `MessageProcessor` (or equivalent), insert:

  1. build evaluation input
  2. run ethics-core evaluation
  3. apply breaker action (refuse/redirect/rewrite/allow)
* Ensure provenance reflects breaker action (where applicable).

**Deliverable:** Breaker actions deterministically gate responses; planner output cannot bypass it.

---

## Phase 9 — Minimal structured events (incidents + breakers)

**Goal:** Add structured log events for auditing and debugging.

**Key tasks**

* Emit compact JSON events (privacy-safe) for:

  * `incident.created`
  * `incident.remediated`
  * `incident.status_changed`
  * `breaker.tripped`
* Include correlation fields: incidentId (short), responseId/traceId when available, ruleId, action.

**Deliverable:** Incidents and breaker trips are grep-able, correlatable, and privacy-preserving.
